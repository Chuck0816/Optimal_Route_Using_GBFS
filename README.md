# This project showcases the implementation of the Greedy Best-First Search algorithm applied to a real-world scenario. The primary objective is to minimize the time required to find the optimal route from a given starting point to a specified destination. The algorithm leverages the Manhattan distance as a heuristic to guide the search process. By prioritizing exploration based on proximity to the goal, this approach demonstrates an efficient way to solve pathfinding problems in practical applications.
